## Overview

Developed a robust Java library that implements essential data structures and algorithms, designed to serve as both a learning resource and a practical tool for software development. The project emphasizes clean code practices, comprehensive documentation, and efficient implementations.

## Key Features

- **Data Structures**: Implemented core data structures including Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, Heaps, Hash Tables, and Graphs with proper generics support.
- **Algorithms**: Included sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort), searching algorithms (Binary Search, BFS, DFS), and graph algorithms (Dijkstra's, Prim's, Kruskal's).
- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Each implementation includes detailed time and space complexity analysis in the documentation.
- **JUnit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite covering edge cases and ensuring reliability.
- **Documentation**: Detailed Javadoc comments explaining usage, parameters, and return values for all public methods.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**: Core language with features like Records, Pattern Matching, and Streams.
- **JUnit 5**: For writing and running tests.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and build automation.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipeline and automated testing.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was optimizing the graph algorithms for both time and space complexity while maintaining code readability. Implementing the A* search algorithm was particularly educational, as it required a deep understanding of heuristics and priority queues.

I also learned the importance of proper documentation and test coverage when building a reusable library. Writing comprehensive tests helped catch edge cases I hadn't initially considered.

## Outcome

The library has been used in multiple academic projects and coding competitions. It has helped me and my peers better understand fundamental computer science concepts and has improved our problem-solving skills. The project is open-source and has received positive feedback from the developer community.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more advanced algorithms like dynamic programming solutions
- Implement concurrent data structures
- Add visualization capabilities for better understanding of algorithms
- Create interactive examples and tutorials
- Support for more complex graph algorithms
