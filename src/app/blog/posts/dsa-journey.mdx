## Current Focus

I'm currently diving deep into advanced data structures and algorithms in Java, with a particular focus on:

- **Lists**: Optimizing operations and exploring different implementations, including Java's ArrayList and LinkedList
- **HashMaps**: Advanced hashing techniques and collision resolution strategies in Java's HashMap implementation
- **String Algorithms**: Pattern matching, string manipulation, and text processing using Java's String and StringBuilder
- **Trees**: Implementing and analyzing advanced tree structures including AVL, Red-Black, and B-trees in Java
- **Graph Algorithms**: Pathfinding, network flows, and advanced traversal techniques with Java's collections

## Recent Work

- Implemented a custom HashMap in Java with open addressing and perfect hashing, comparing performance with Java's built-in HashMap
- Developed efficient string search algorithms in Java, including KMP and Rabin-Karp for pattern matching
- Optimized tree-based data structures in Java for memory efficiency and performance
- Explored advanced graph algorithms in Java for network analysis and optimization
